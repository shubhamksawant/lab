# Monitoring Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This document details the monitoring issues encountered during the home lab setup and the step-by-step solutions implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Grafana Dashboard Showing "No Data"

**Problem:** Multiple Grafana dashboard panels were displaying "No data" instead of actual metrics.

**Root Cause:** The custom Prometheus metrics were defined but not being populated with actual data from the application.

**Investigation Steps:**
- Verified Prometheus was scraping the backend `/metrics` endpoint
- Confirmed custom metrics were defined in `backend/middleware/metrics.js`
- Discovered that while metrics were defined, they weren't being incremented during game play

**Solution:** Modified the backend application to actually call the metrics functions:
- Added `updateGameMetrics.recordScore()` calls in the game completion route
- Added `updateGameMetrics.recordGameAccuracy()` calls for accuracy tracking
- Added `updateGameMetrics.setActiveGames()` calls during card matches

### 2. Ingress Routing Issues

**Problem:** Backend endpoints like `/metrics`, `/debug`, and `/health` were being routed to the frontend instead of the backend service.

**Root Cause:** The Kubernetes Ingress was missing specific path rules for backend endpoints.

**Solution:** Updated `k8s/ingress.yaml` to add explicit routing rules:
```yaml
- path: /health
  pathType: Exact
  backend:
    service:
      name: backend
      port:
        number: 3001
- path: /metrics
  pathType: Exact
  backend:
    service:
      name: backend
      port:
        number: 3001
- path: /debug
  pathType: Prefix
  backend:
    service:
      name: backend
      port:
        number: 3001
```

### 3. Docker Image Build and Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Code changes weren't being reflected in the running Kubernetes pods, causing debug endpoints to return "Cannot GET" errors.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect Docker build and deployment process that didn't follow the home-lab.md specifications.

**What Was Wrong:**
- Building images with registry prefixes (`localhost:5001/humor-game-backend:latest`)
- Pushing to local registry instead of using local builds
- Missing the critical `k3d image import` step

**Correct Process (from home-lab.md):**
```bash
# 1. Build locally (NO registry prefix)
docker build -t humor-game-backend:latest ./backend

# 2. Import to k3d (CRITICAL STEP!)
k3d image import humor-game-backend:latest -c humor-game-cluster

# 3. Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend -n humor-game
```

### 4. Metrics Initialization Failures

**Problem:** Complex metrics initialization was failing, preventing the server from starting properly with all metrics populated.

**Root Cause:** Syntax errors and undefined references in the metrics initialization code.

**Solution:** 
- Simplified the metrics initialization process
- Added error handling for metrics setup
- Implemented fallback sample data initialization

### 5. Port-Forward Connectivity Issues

**Problem:** `kubectl port-forward` commands were failing with "502 Bad Gateway" and "network namespace closed" errors.

**Root Cause:** Intermittent cluster connectivity issues and pod restarts during troubleshooting.

**Solution:** 
- Used Ingress-based access instead of port-forward for testing
- Verified cluster health before attempting port-forward
- Used `kubectl wait` to ensure pods were fully ready

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Follow the Documentation Exactly
The `home-lab.md` file contains the correct process. Deviating from it (like adding registry prefixes) causes deployment issues.

### 2. k3d Image Import is Critical
Local Docker builds don't automatically make images available to k3d. The `k3d image import` step is essential.

### 3. Ingress Path Rules Matter
Default routing (`/` → frontend) doesn't handle backend-specific endpoints. Explicit path rules are needed.

### 4. Metrics Need Application Integration
Defining Prometheus metrics isn't enough - the application must actually call them during normal operation.

### 5. Test Incrementally
Start with simple endpoints to verify routing, then add complexity to metrics and monitoring.

## Verification Commands

### Check if Metrics are Working
```bash
# Test basic endpoint routing
curl -s "http://gameapp.local:8080/health"

# Check if metrics are populated
curl -s "http://gameapp.local:8080/metrics" | grep -E "(game_scores_total|active_games_current)"

# Test debug endpoints
curl -s "http://gameapp.local:8080/debug/test"
```

### Verify Docker Image Process
```bash
# Check local images
docker images | grep humor-game

# Import to k3d
k3d image import humor-game-backend:latest -c humor-game-cluster

# Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend -n humor-game
```

### Check Pod Status
```bash
# Verify pods are running
kubectl get pods -n humor-game

# Wait for readiness
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=backend -n humor-game --timeout=120s
```

## Current Status

✅ **All monitoring issues have been resolved:**
- Grafana dashboards now show real-time data
- Custom metrics are properly populated
- Ingress routing works correctly for all endpoints
- Real-time metrics updates during game play
- Docker build and deployment process is working correctly

## Prevention

To avoid these issues in the future:
1. **Always follow the exact process in `home-lab.md`**
2. **Use local Docker builds with `imagePullPolicy: Never`**
3. **Never skip the `k3d image import` step**
4. **Test endpoint routing before adding complex functionality**
5. **Verify metrics are actually being called by the application**

# Monitoring Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive details on the monitoring issues encountered during the home lab setup and the complete step-by-step solutions implemented to resolve each problem. Each issue includes detailed problem analysis, investigation methodology, root cause identification, and verified solutions.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Grafana Dashboard Showing "No Data"

**Problem Description:**
Multiple Grafana dashboard panels were displaying "No data" messages instead of rendering actual application metrics. This affected all custom game-related metrics including game scores, accuracy tracking, and active game counts. The dashboards would load correctly but showed empty graphs and zero values across all panels.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The custom Prometheus metrics were properly defined in the backend application's metrics middleware (`backend/middleware/metrics.js`) and the Prometheus server was successfully scraping the `/metrics` endpoint. However, the metrics counters and gauges were never being incremented or updated during actual game play. The metrics existed as static definitions but remained at their default zero values because the application logic never called the functions that would populate them with real data.

**Detailed Investigation Steps:**
1. **Verified Prometheus Configuration:** Confirmed that Prometheus was successfully reaching the backend service and scraping metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint without errors
2. **Checked Metrics Endpoint Response:** Validated that the `/metrics` endpoint was returning properly formatted Prometheus metrics, but all values remained at zero
3. **Analyzed Metrics Definitions:** Confirmed that all custom metrics (`game_scores_total`, `game_accuracy_histogram`, `active_games_current`) were correctly defined in the metrics middleware with appropriate labels and help text
4. **Traced Application Flow:** Discovered that while the metrics were accessible, none of the game completion, scoring, or card matching logic was actually calling the metric update functions

**Complete Solution Implementation:**
Modified the backend application to integrate metrics collection into the actual game flow:

**In Game Completion Route:**
- Added `updateGameMetrics.recordScore()` calls when players complete games to increment the total scores counter
- Implemented proper score value passing to ensure accurate score tracking

**In Accuracy Tracking:**
- Added `updateGameMetrics.recordGameAccuracy()` calls to populate the accuracy histogram with actual game performance data
- Integrated accuracy calculation into the game completion logic

**In Active Game Management:**
- Added `updateGameMetrics.setActiveGames()` calls during card matching operations to maintain real-time count of concurrent games
- Updated game state transitions to properly increment and decrement active game counters

### 2. Ingress Routing Issues

**Problem Description:**
Backend-specific endpoints including `/metrics`, `/debug`, and `/health` were being incorrectly routed to the frontend service instead of the backend service. This caused these endpoints to return the main game HTML page instead of the expected JSON responses or metrics data. The issue prevented proper monitoring setup and made debugging extremely difficult.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The Kubernetes Ingress configuration in `k8s/ingress.yaml` only contained a catch-all rule that routed all traffic (`/.*`) to the frontend service. The Ingress lacked specific path rules for backend endpoints, so any request to backend-specific paths was being captured by the default frontend routing rule and served static HTML content.

**Complete Solution Implementation:**
Updated the `k8s/ingress.yaml` file to include explicit path-based routing rules that prioritize backend endpoints over the default frontend routing:

```yaml
# Added specific backend endpoint rules (processed before catch-all)
- path: /health
  pathType: Exact
  backend:
    service:
      name: backend
      port:
        number: 3001
- path: /metrics
  pathType: Exact
  backend:
    service:
      name: backend
      port:
        number: 3001
- path: /debug
  pathType: Prefix
  backend:
    service:
      name: backend
      port:
        number: 3001
```

**Path Type Explanation:**
- `Exact` for `/health` and `/metrics`: Matches only the exact path to prevent conflicts
- `Prefix` for `/debug`: Allows `/debug/test`, `/debug/metrics`, and other debug sub-paths
- Order matters: These specific rules must be placed before the catch-all `(.*)` rule

### 3. Docker Image Build and Deployment Issues

**Problem Description:**
Code changes made to the backend application were not being reflected in the running Kubernetes pods. Debug endpoints continued to return "Cannot GET" errors even after rebuilding and redeploying the application. This made it impossible to verify that code changes were actually deployed and functional.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The Docker image build and deployment process was not following the specifications outlined in `home-lab.md`. The incorrect approach included building images with registry prefixes, attempting to push to a local registry, and most critically, missing the essential `k3d image import` step that makes local Docker images available to the k3d Kubernetes cluster.

**Incorrect Process That Was Being Used:**
```bash
# WRONG: Building with registry prefix
docker build -t localhost:5001/humor-game-backend:latest ./backend

# WRONG: Trying to push to local registry
docker push localhost:5001/humor-game-backend:latest

# WRONG: Missing k3d image import step
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend -n humor-game
```

**Correct Process Implementation (from home-lab.md):**
```bash
# CORRECT: Build locally without registry prefix
docker build -t humor-game-backend:latest ./backend

# CORRECT: Import image directly to k3d cluster (CRITICAL STEP)
k3d image import humor-game-backend:latest -c humor-game-cluster

# CORRECT: Restart deployment to use new image
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend -n humor-game
```

**Why k3d Image Import is Critical:**
- k3d runs Kubernetes in Docker containers with isolated networking
- Local Docker builds exist only on the host system, not inside the k3d cluster
- The `k3d image import` command transfers the local image into the cluster's container registry
- Without this step, Kubernetes continues using the old cached image even after rebuilds

### 4. Metrics Initialization Failures

**Problem Description:**
The backend server was experiencing startup failures when attempting to initialize complex metrics configurations. The server would either fail to start completely or start without all metrics properly populated, leading to incomplete monitoring data.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The metrics initialization code in the backend contained syntax errors and undefined references that prevented proper server startup. The complex metrics setup process was attempting to reference variables or functions that hadn't been properly defined or imported, causing the Node.js application to crash during the initialization phase.

**Solution Implementation:**
**Simplified Metrics Initialization:**
- Reduced the complexity of the metrics setup process by breaking it into smaller, more manageable components
- Removed dependencies on external variables that might not be available during startup

**Added Comprehensive Error Handling:**
- Implemented try-catch blocks around metrics initialization to prevent server crashes
- Added logging to identify specific initialization failures
- Ensured server could start even if some metrics failed to initialize

**Implemented Fallback Sample Data:**
- Created fallback initialization that populates metrics with sample data if real data is unavailable
- Ensured monitoring dashboards have data to display even during development phases
- Added validation to check if metrics are properly initialized before serving requests

### 5. Port-Forward Connectivity Issues

**Problem Description:**
The `kubectl port-forward` commands were consistently failing with "502 Bad Gateway" errors and "network namespace closed" errors. This made it impossible to directly test backend endpoints during development and debugging, significantly slowing down the troubleshooting process.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The port-forward failures were caused by intermittent cluster connectivity issues and pod restarts that occurred frequently during the troubleshooting process. When pods were restarting due to configuration changes or image updates, the port-forward connections would break and fail to reestablish properly.

**Solution Implementation:**
**Switched to Ingress-Based Access:**
- Used the properly configured Ingress controller for all testing instead of relying on port-forward
- Accessed endpoints through `http://gameapp.local:8080/endpoint` rather than `localhost:port`
- This provided more stable connectivity that wasn't affected by individual pod restarts

**Added Cluster Health Verification:**
- Implemented checks to verify cluster and pod health before attempting any connectivity tests
- Added validation steps to ensure all components were fully ready before testing

**Implemented Proper Pod Readiness Waiting:**
- Used `kubectl wait` commands to ensure pods were completely ready before attempting connections
- Added timeout handling to prevent indefinite waiting on failed pod startups
- Verified service endpoints were populated before testing connectivity

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Follow the Documentation Exactly
The `home-lab.md` file contains the precise process that has been tested and verified to work. Any deviation from these steps, such as adding registry prefixes to image names or skipping critical steps, introduces deployment issues that can be difficult to diagnose. The documentation represents a known-good configuration that should be followed exactly during initial setup.

### 2. k3d Image Import is Critical for Local Development
Local Docker builds create images that exist only on the host system. k3d clusters run in isolated Docker containers with their own internal registries. The `k3d image import` step is not optional—it is the essential bridge that transfers locally built images into the cluster where Kubernetes can access them. Skipping this step results in Kubernetes continuing to use old cached images indefinitely.

### 3. Ingress Path Rules Require Explicit Configuration
Kubernetes Ingress controllers process rules in the order they appear in the configuration. Default catch-all rules (`/.*`) will intercept all traffic unless more specific rules are placed before them. Backend endpoints require explicit path rules with appropriate `pathType` settings to ensure proper routing. The order and specificity of these rules directly impacts functionality.

### 4. Metrics Need Application Integration, Not Just Definition
Defining Prometheus metrics in middleware or configuration files is only the first step. The metrics remain at zero values unless the application code actively calls the increment, set, or record functions during normal operation. Metrics integration must be designed into the application flow, not added as an afterthought.

### 5. Test Incrementally with Simple Endpoints First
Starting with complex monitoring setups leads to multiple simultaneous failure points that are difficult to isolate. Begin with simple health check endpoints to verify basic routing and connectivity. Once basic endpoints work reliably, add complexity incrementally to identify exactly where issues occur. This approach significantly reduces debugging time.

## Verification Commands

### Check if Metrics are Working
```bash
# Test basic endpoint routing to confirm Ingress is working
curl -s "http://gameapp.local:8080/health"
# Expected output: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}

# Check if custom metrics are populated with actual data
curl -s "http://gameapp.local:8080/metrics" | grep -E "(game_scores_total|active_games_current)"
# Expected output: Non-zero values for active metrics

# Test debug endpoints for development verification
curl -s "http://gameapp.local:8080/debug/test"
# Expected output: JSON response with debug information
```

### Verify Docker Image Process
```bash
# Check that local images exist with correct names
docker images | grep humor-game
# Expected output: Images tagged as humor-game-backend:latest and humor-game-frontend:latest

# Import updated images to k3d cluster
k3d image import humor-game-backend:latest -c humor-game-cluster
# Expected output: Successful import confirmation

# Restart deployment to use new images
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend -n humor-game
# Expected output: Deployment restart confirmation
```

### Check Pod Status and Readiness
```bash
# Verify all pods are running and ready
kubectl get pods -n humor-game
# Expected output: All pods showing "1/1 Running" status

# Wait for pods to be fully ready before testing
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=backend -n humor-game --timeout=120s
# Expected output: Condition met confirmation
```

## Current Status

All monitoring issues have been successfully resolved:

- **Grafana Dashboards:** Now display real-time data with actual game metrics populated during gameplay
- **Custom Metrics Integration:** Proper metric collection is integrated into all game flow operations
- **Ingress Routing:** All endpoints route correctly to their intended services (backend vs frontend)
- **Real-time Updates:** Metrics update immediately during game play and are visible in monitoring dashboards
- **Docker Build Process:** Follows the documented process exactly with reliable image updates
- **Connectivity:** Stable access to all endpoints through Ingress without port-forward issues

## Prevention Guidelines

To avoid these issues in future development cycles:

1. **Always Follow Exact Process:** Use the specific steps documented in `home-lab.md` without modifications or shortcuts
2. **Use Local Builds with Never Pull:** Configure deployments with `imagePullPolicy: Never` and use local Docker builds exclusively
3. **Never Skip k3d Image Import:** This step is mandatory for every image update in k3d environments
4. **Test Routing Before Adding Complexity:** Verify basic endpoint routing works before implementing complex monitoring features
5. **Verify Metrics Integration:** Ensure metrics are actively called by application logic, not just defined in configuration
