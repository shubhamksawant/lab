# We'll add these in order to avoid dependency issues:
# 1. ✅ Core infrastructure (Redis, Postgres) ← COMPLETED
# 2. ✅ Application deployments (Backend, Frontend) ← COMPLETED
# 3. ✅ GitOps setup complete! (HPAs removed - not needed)

# NO patches - keeping it simple to avoid conflicts
# NO common labels - this prevents conflicts with your working app
